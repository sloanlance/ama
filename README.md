# Ask me anything!<sup>1,2</sup> <br/> <sup>1</sup> Coding and Technology Edition <br/> <sup>2</sup>_Expurgated Version_

> ℹ️ **Unfortunately, I'm often too busy to answer questions quickly.  I'll answer them as time allows.**

"Anything" means *anything about coding and technology* and maybe some other things, too.  Work.  Code.  Life.  Philosophy.  Personal questions (I'll answer only if I'm in the mood).

- ## [Ask a question](../../issues/new)
- ## [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs, feature requests, and support questions about some other project should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be civil and polite.
