# Ask me anything! â€” Coding and Technology Edition

**Unfortunately, I'm usually too busy to answer questions quickly.  I'll answer them whenever I have time.**

- ## [Ask a question](../../issues/new)
- ## [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

"Anything" means *anything about coding and technology*.  Work.  Code.  Life.  Philosophy.  Maybe personal questions, if I'm in the mood.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs, feature requests, and support questions about some other project should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Be civil and polite.
